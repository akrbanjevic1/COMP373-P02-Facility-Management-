# COMP373-P02-Facility-Management-
This is the repo for Project 2. This project builds off of what we made (as a group) in 
the first project for the class.

The Context file can be found under the "META-INF" folder.

The "Main.java" file in the View folder (from here, one can really see how Spring changed
the code).

Some of our classes had to be slightly modified from Project 1 in order to better collaborate
with Spring Tool Suite 4.

Environment Info:
This project was built using Java SE 11 and with Spring Tool Suite 4. Eclipse 4.18.0 was used to assist when
we wrote the code for this program.
